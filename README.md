## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm Zickrian, a passionate developer who's been on this coding journey since 2023. 

<p align="left">
✨ I love turning ideas into code (and yes, I create bugs too, but hey, that's how we learn! 😄)<br>
📚 Currently diving deep into <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and AI technologies - it's fascinating!<br>
🛡️ Recently got certified with <strong>ASAH by Dicoding</strong> - always learning something new!<br>
🎯 My current goals: Building my first major web app and landing that dream internship<br>
🎲 Fun fact: I'm a night owl who codes best with a cup of coffee ☕ and some good music 🎵<br>
💡 Always open to collaborate on interesting projects or just chat about tech!
